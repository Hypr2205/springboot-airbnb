# Airbnb Clone

This project aims to build a fully functional clone of Airbnb, a platform connecting hosts with guests for short-term
rentals. We'll start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate the concept, then expand with additional features
based on user feedback.

## Introduction

An Airbnb clone is a platform that connects hosts offering accommodations with guests seeking short-term rentals. The
goal is to create a scalable, user-friendly system that replicates core functionalities while allowing for
customization. Given the complexity, starting with an MVP is recommended to validate the concept before expanding with
additional features
